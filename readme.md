# Cryptography that everyone can understand (people of insight are welcome to participate and contribute)
This repository also available in [russian language](readme.ru.md).

The goal of this book is to simplify the difficult-to-understand cryptography, so that more people can read cryptography and become interested in it. To read this book, you need to have a certain mathematical theoretical fundament. This book provides theoretical and practice parts with simple implementations of algorithms and primitives which is described in this repository.

This book is in the writing stage. This book will always follow the development of cryptography technology and will be updated at any time. The content may not be consistent. I hope readers will forgive me. Due to the limited level of the author who wrote this book, if there is any doubt in the book, you can bring it up and discuss it together. **All of you are welcome to contribute!**
